# ACTaM Project 2024/25 - Musicmind
Musicmind is an educative browser game that provides players a fun way to do ear training.

## Repository Rules
1. Whenever you do a commit, give it a self explanatory title and a well detailed description in order to have a tied up history.
2. Always write down comments in JS files, so everybody can understand what the code does.
3. Whenever you create a new HTML element which is similar to another one we already created, recycle the old layout as much as possible (for instance all minigames will have a similar layout, only the input interface will be different).
4. When you develop a new functionality always do it on a new JS file (for instance if you develop a minigame, his related function will have to be stored in the file "minigameName.js")
